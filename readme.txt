use CASTp 3.0 to find the active sites of the enzyme

Note that this code assumes that the input PDB file contains only ATOM records, and that the desired residues are specified in the same format as the ATOM records 

while providing input, provide it in the format (i.e. three-letter residue name, followed by chain identifier, followed by residue number)
for ex. GLN A 213
        PRO E  69  (Note if the residue number is double digit, leave a space before)
        
difference between two scripts

draft.py - open the file and provide input as strings in the code itself and mention the name of the input file and run it by opening the working directory in terminal and using the command - 'python draft.py'

draft2.py - open working directory in terminal and run the command - 'python draft2.py' and follow the steps on screen

visualise the output with PyMol
